Prayer for the Long Life of Tulku Thondup Rinpoche
by Gyalse Möndrup Dorje

om svasti
Oṃ svasti!
chok sum lha dang drangsong denpé tü
By the power of the truth of the Three Jewels, deities and sages,
ngawang lo zang dön kün drubpa yi
May the lotus feet of Ngawang Lobzang Döndrup, ‘Lord of Speech, the Noble-Minded One who Accomplishes
All Aims’,
shyabpé dorjé tri la takten né
Remain forever secure upon the vajra throne,
pendé ö kyi duljé gyü min shok
And the light of his beneficial and joyful activity mature the minds of disciples.

Thus, to signify an auspicious connection, this was written by Gyalse Möndrup Dorje.1
