Sweet Song of Enduring Deathlessness
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

om svasti
Oṃ svasti!
tsen tsam gyi kyang chimé chok jin ma
Your name alone bestows sublime immortality,
yeshe chen dün nampar trawé ku
You have seven wisdom eyes and a radiant form,
gang sung jöpa kün gyi yang dangden
And your speech is melodious in all its expressions—
lama yishyin khorlö tukjé zik
Exalted Wish-Fulfilling Wheel, look upon me with compassion!

jamyang lamé jinlab trulpé ku
Nirmāṇakāya with the blessings of the Mañjughoṣa guru,
chökyi lodrö lekpé lam tönpa
Who reveals the path of excellent Dharma understanding
shedrub tenpé gyaltsen chok chur dreng
And raises the victory banner of teaching and practice in the ten directions—
palden lamé shyabpé yünten sol
Glorious guru, I pray that your lotus feet may long remain secure.

detar solwa tabpé jinlab kyi
Through the blessings of praying in this way,
jetsün lamé kutsé gekwar shyi
May any obstacles to the precious guru’s longevity be pacified,
ten dang drowé dekyi petsal shyé
May the lotus garden of happiness and wellbeing for the teachings and beings bloom,
la lob changchub bardu mindral shok
And may guru and disciples remain inseparable until awakening!

Thus, I wrote this myself in response to a request from the tulku of Dzongsar Ngari Chöjé1 supported
by an auspicious silk scarf and silver image on the first ‘joy’ of the (dbo zla)
in the Pig year. May it prove significant!
